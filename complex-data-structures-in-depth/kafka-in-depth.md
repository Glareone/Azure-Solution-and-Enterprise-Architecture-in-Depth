## FAQ
1. Does Kafka has both Queues and Topics. Kafka supports both options under one service "kafka topics"?
   - Topics with Multiple Consumer Groups (Publish-Subscribe Pattern): Multiple consumer groups can read from the same topic. Each consumer group receives all messages. This behaves like a traditional pub/sub system.

   - Topics with Single Consumer Group (Queue-like Pattern): One consumer group with multiple consumers. Messages are distributed across consumers in the group. Each message is processed by only one consumer in the group. This behaves like a traditional queue.

2. Can Kafka manage millions of topics?
   - Yes, it can. It could be a good choice for chats where you need to support message delivery and offline queue per registered user (if user is offline).
